### Problem 79: Word Search

#### Problem Statement
Given an `m x n` grid of characters `board` and a string `word`, return `true` if `word` exists in the grid.

The word can be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cells, where "adjacent" cells are horizontally or vertically neighboring. The same letter cell may not be used more than once.

---

#### Examples

1. **Input**:  
   ```
   board = [["A","B","C","E"],
            ["S","F","C","S"],
            ["A","D","E","E"]],
   word = "ABCCED"
   ```
   **Output**: `true`

2. **Input**:  
   ```
   board = [["A","B","C","E"],
            ["S","F","C","S"],
            ["A","D","E","E"]],
   word = "SEE"
   ```
   **Output**: `true`

3. **Input**:  
   ```
   board = [["A","B","C","E"],
            ["S","F","C","S"],
            ["A","D","E","E"]],
   word = "ABCB"
   ```
   **Output**: `false`

---

#### Constraints

- \( 1 \leq \text{board.length}, \text{board[i].length} \leq 6 \)
- \( 1 \leq \text{word.length} \leq 15 \)
- The `board` and `word` consist only of lowercase and uppercase English letters.

---

#### Topics

- Array
- Backtracking
- Matrix

### Process (Plain English Explanation)

1. **Key Idea**:
   - Use **backtracking** to search for the word in the grid.
   - Start from each cell in the grid and try to form the word by exploring all valid neighbors.
   - Use a visited matrix or mark cells as visited temporarily to avoid reusing the same cell.

2. **Steps**:
   - For each cell in the grid, start a recursive search.
   - In each recursive call, check:
     - If the current character matches the target character in the word.
     - If all characters in the word are matched.
   - Explore the four possible directions (up, down, left, right) from the current cell.
   - Restore the cell after exploring to allow other paths to use it.

3. **Termination**:
   - Return `true` if all characters are matched.
   - Return `false` if no valid path is found.

---

### Pseudocode

1. **Initialize**:
   - Iterate over each cell in the grid.
   - If the starting cell matches the first character of the word, begin a depth-first search (DFS).

2. **DFS Function**:
   - Check if the current index matches the word's length (all characters are matched).
   - Check if the current cell is within bounds and matches the current character in the word.
   - Temporarily mark the cell as visited.
   - Explore all four directions (up, down, left, right).
   - Restore the cell after exploration.

3. **Output Results**:
   - If any DFS returns `true`, the word exists in the grid.

### Java Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean exist(char[][] board, String word) {
        int rows = board.length;
        int cols = board[0].length;

        for (int i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < cols; j++) {
                // Start a DFS search if the first character matches
                if (dfs(board, word, 0, i, j)) {
                    return true;
                }
            }
        }

        return false;
    }

    private boolean dfs(char[][] board, String word, int index, int row, int col) {
        // If the entire word is matched
        if (index == word.length()) {
            return true;
        }

        // Check boundary conditions and if the character matches
        if (row < 0 || row >= board.length || col < 0 || col >= board[0].length || board[row][col] != word.charAt(index)) {
            return false;
        }

        // Mark the current cell as visited
        char temp = board[row][col];
        board[row][col] = '#';

        // Explore all four directions
        boolean found = dfs(board, word, index + 1, row - 1, col) ||  // Up
                        dfs(board, word, index + 1, row + 1, col) ||  // Down
                        dfs(board, word, index + 1, row, col - 1) ||  // Left
                        dfs(board, word, index + 1, row, col + 1);    // Right

        // Restore the current cell
        board[row][col] = temp;

        return found;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution solution = new Solution();

        // Test case 1
        char[][] board1 = {
            {'A', 'B', 'C', 'E'},
            {'S', 'F', 'C', 'S'},
            {'A', 'D', 'E', 'E'}
        };
        String word1 = "ABCCED";
        System.out.println("Input: board = [[A,B,C,E],[S,F,C,S],[A,D,E,E]], word = ABCCED");
        System.out.println("Output: " + solution.exist(board1, word1)); // true

        // Test case 2
        char[][] board2 = {
            {'A', 'B', 'C', 'E'},
            {'S', 'F', 'C', 'S'},
            {'A', 'D', 'E', 'E'}
        };
        String word2 = "SEE";
        System.out.println("Input: board = [[A,B,C,E],[S,F,C,S],[A,D,E,E]], word = SEE");
        System.out.println("Output: " + solution.exist(board2, word2)); // true

        // Test case 3
        char[][] board3 = {
            {'A', 'B', 'C', 'E'},
            {'S', 'F', 'C', 'S'},
            {'A', 'D', 'E', 'E'}
        };
        String word3 = "ABCB";
        System.out.println("Input: board = [[A,B,C,E],[S,F,C,S],[A,D,E,E]], word = ABCB");
        System.out.println("Output: " + solution.exist(board3, word3)); // false
    }
}

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Initialization**:
   - Iterate through each cell in the board to find potential starting points.

2. **DFS**:
   - Match the current cell with the word's character.
   - Temporarily mark the cell as visited to prevent revisiting.
   - Explore neighbors recursively.
   - Restore the cell's state after exploration.

3. **Main Method**:
   - Includes test cases with expected outputs.
