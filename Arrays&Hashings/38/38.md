### Problem 38: Count and Say

#### Problem Statement
The **count-and-say** sequence is a sequence of digit strings defined by the recursive formula:
- `countAndSay(1) = "1"`
- `countAndSay(n)` is the run-length encoding of `countAndSay(n - 1)`.

Run-length encoding (RLE) is a string compression method that works by replacing consecutive identical characters (appearing 2 or more times) with the concatenation of the character and the number marking the count of the character's length. For example:
- To generate the sequence for \(n = 4\), the steps are as follows:
  - `countAndSay(1) = "1"`
  - `countAndSay(2)` = RLE of `"1"` = `"11"`
  - `countAndSay(3)` = RLE of `"11"` = `"21"`
  - `countAndSay(4)` = RLE of `"21"` = `"1211"`

Given a positive integer \(n\), return the \(n\)-th element of the count-and-say sequence.

#### Examples

1. **Input**:  
   ```
   n = 4
   ```
   **Output**:  
   ```
   "1211"
   ```
   **Explanation**:  
   - \(n = 1\): `"1"`
   - \(n = 2\): `"11"` (one 1)
   - \(n = 3\): `"21"` (two 1s)
   - \(n = 4\): `"1211"` (one 2, then one 1)

2. **Input**:  
   ```
   n = 1
   ```
   **Output**:  
   ```
   "1"
   ```
   **Explanation**: This is the base case.

#### Constraints
- \(1 \leq n \leq 30\)

#### Topics
- String

### Process (Plain English Explanation)

1. **Base Case**:
   - The sequence starts with \(countAndSay(1) = "1"\).

2. **Recursive Generation**:
   - For each subsequent sequence, iterate over the previous sequence string.
   - Count the number of consecutive identical characters.
   - Append the count followed by the character to build the new sequence.

3. **Repeat for \(n\) Times**:
   - Start with `"1"`.
   - For each iteration, generate the next sequence using the previous one.

---

### Pseudocode

1. **Initialize**:
   - Start with the sequence `"1"`.
2. **Iterate**:
   - For each number from 2 to \(n\):
     - Initialize an empty result string for the next sequence.
     - Traverse the current sequence:
       - Count consecutive identical characters.
       - Append the count and the character to the result string.
3. **Return Result**:
   - After generating the sequence for \(n\), return it.

### Java Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public String countAndSay(int n) {
        if (n == 1) {
            return "1"; // Base case
        }

        String result = "1";
        for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
            StringBuilder next = new StringBuilder();
            int count = 1;
            for (int j = 1; j < result.length(); j++) {
                if (result.charAt(j) == result.charAt(j - 1)) {
                    count++;
                } else {
                    next.append(count).append(result.charAt(j - 1));
                    count = 1;
                }
            }
            next.append(count).append(result.charAt(result.length() - 1));
            result = next.toString();
        }

        return result;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution solution = new Solution();

        // Test case 1
        int n1 = 4;
        System.out.println("Input: n = 4 -> Output: " + solution.countAndSay(n1)); // Expected: "1211"

        // Test case 2
        int n2 = 1;
        System.out.println("Input: n = 1 -> Output: " + solution.countAndSay(n2)); // Expected: "1"

        // Test case 3
        int n3 = 5;
        System.out.println("Input: n = 5 -> Output: " + solution.countAndSay(n3)); // Expected: "111221"
    }
}
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Base Case**:
   - If \(n = 1\), the result is `"1"`.

2. **Iterative Generation**:
   - Start with the initial sequence `"1"`.
   - For each step, analyze the current sequence:
     - Count consecutive characters.
     - Append the count and the character to build the next sequence.

3. **Result Construction**:
   - Use a `StringBuilder` to efficiently construct the next sequence.
   - Append the last group of characters after the loop.

### Outputs for Given Test Cases

1. **Input**: \(n = 4\)  
   **Output**: `"1211"`

2. **Input**: \(n = 1\)  
   **Output**: `"1"`

3. **Input**: \(n = 5\)  
   **Output**: `"111221"`
