### Problem 539: Minimum Time Difference

#### Problem Statement
Given a list of 24-hour clock time points in `"HH:MM"` format, return the minimum **minutes** difference between any two time-points in the list.

---

#### Examples

1. **Input**: `timePoints = ["23:59","00:00"]`  
   **Output**: `1`  
   **Explanation**:  
   The time difference between "23:59" and "00:00" is `1` minute.

2. **Input**: `timePoints = ["00:00","23:59","00:00"]`  
   **Output**: `0`  
   **Explanation**:  
   Since "00:00" appears twice, the minimum difference is `0`.

---

#### Constraints
- `2 <= timePoints.length <= 2 * 10^4`
- `timePoints[i]` is in the format `"HH:MM"`

---

#### Topics
- Array
- Math
- Sorting

### Process (Plain English Explanation)

1. **Convert Times**: Convert each time string into its total minutes from midnight for easier comparison.
2. **Sort the Times**: Sort the converted times in ascending order to calculate differences efficiently.
3. **Compare Adjacent Differences**:
   - Calculate the difference between consecutive times.
   - Also, consider the circular difference between the last time and the first time (wrapping around midnight).
4. **Track Minimum Difference**: Return the smallest difference found.

### Pseudocode

1. **Input**: List of time points.
2. Convert each time string into minutes using:
   - `hours * 60 + minutes`.
3. Sort the converted times.
4. Initialize `minDiff` as `Integer.MAX_VALUE`.
5. Compare:
   - Differences between consecutive times.
   - Circular difference between the last and first time using `1440 - (last - first)`.
6. Return `minDiff`.

### Java Solution

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Collections;
import java.util.List;

class Solution {
    public int findMinDifference(List<String> timePoints) {
        // Convert all times to minutes from midnight
        List<Integer> minutes = new ArrayList<>();
        for (String time : timePoints) {
            String[] parts = time.split(":");
            int totalMinutes = Integer.parseInt(parts[0]) * 60 + Integer.parseInt(parts[1]);
            minutes.add(totalMinutes);
        }

        // Sort the times
        Collections.sort(minutes);

        // Initialize minimum difference
        int minDiff = Integer.MAX_VALUE;

        // Compare consecutive times
        for (int i = 1; i < minutes.size(); i++) {
            minDiff = Math.min(minDiff, minutes.get(i) - minutes.get(i - 1));
        }

        // Circular difference between the last and first time
        int circularDiff = 1440 - (minutes.get(minutes.size() - 1) - minutes.get(0));
        minDiff = Math.min(minDiff, circularDiff);

        return minDiff;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution solution = new Solution();

        // Test case 1
        List<String> timePoints1 = List.of("23:59", "00:00");
        System.out.println("Input: " + timePoints1 + " -> Output: " + solution.findMinDifference(timePoints1)); // Expected: 1

        // Test case 2
        List<String> timePoints2 = List.of("00:00", "23:59", "00:00");
        System.out.println("Input: " + timePoints2 + " -> Output: " + solution.findMinDifference(timePoints2)); // Expected: 0

        // Test case 3
        List<String> timePoints3 = List.of("01:10", "22:30", "13:45", "12:00");
        System.out.println("Input: " + timePoints3 + " -> Output: " + solution.findMinDifference(timePoints3)); // Expected: Minimum Difference
    }
}
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Conversion to Minutes**:
   - Each time string is converted into total minutes from midnight (`hours * 60 + minutes`).
2. **Sorting**:
   - Sorting simplifies the comparison of consecutive time points.
3. **Circular Comparison**:
   - The circular difference is calculated as `1440 - (last - first)` to handle the wrap-around at midnight.
4. **Result Construction**:
   - The smallest difference across all comparisons is returned.

### Outputs for Given Test Cases

1. **Input**: `["23:59", "00:00"]` -> **Output**: `1`
2. **Input**: `["00:00", "23:59", "00:00"]` -> **Output**: `0`
3. **Input**: `["01:10", "22:30", "13:45", "12:00"]` -> **Output**: Minimum Difference (calculated by code).
