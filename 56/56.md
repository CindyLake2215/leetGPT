### Process (Plain English Explanation)

1. **Sort the Intervals**: Start by sorting the input intervals by their start times. This ensures overlapping intervals are adjacent.
2. **Iterate Through Intervals**: Use a list to keep track of merged intervals. For each interval:
   - If the current interval doesn't overlap with the last merged interval, add it to the merged list.
   - If it does overlap, merge it by updating the end time of the last interval in the merged list.
3. **Return the Merged Intervals**: After processing all intervals, return the list of merged intervals.

### Pseudocode

1. **Input**: Array of intervals
2. **Sort** intervals by their start times.
3. Initialize `merged` as an empty list.
4. For each interval in the sorted array:
   - If `merged` is empty or the current interval does not overlap with the last interval in `merged`, add it to `merged`.
   - Otherwise, update the end time of the last interval in `merged` to the maximum end time between the current and last intervals.
5. Return `merged`.

### Java Solution

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.List;

class Solution {
    public int[][] merge(int[][] intervals) {
        // Sort intervals by start time
        Arrays.sort(intervals, (a, b) -> Integer.compare(a[0], b[0]));
        
        List<int[]> merged = new ArrayList<>();
        
        for (int[] interval : intervals) {
            // If the merged list is empty or the current interval does not overlap
            if (merged.isEmpty() || merged.get(merged.size() - 1)[1] < interval[0]) {
                merged.add(interval);
            } else {
                // Overlap case: update the end time
                merged.get(merged.size() - 1)[1] = Math.max(merged.get(merged.size() - 1)[1], interval[1]);
            }
        }
        
        // Convert merged list to array
        return merged.toArray(new int[merged.size()][]);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution solution = new Solution();
        
        int[][] input1 = {{1, 3}, {2, 6}, {8, 10}, {15, 18}};
        int[][] result1 = solution.merge(input1);
        System.out.println("Merged Intervals: " + Arrays.deepToString(result1));

        int[][] input2 = {{1, 4}, {4, 5}};
        int[][] result2 = solution.merge(input2);
        System.out.println("Merged Intervals: " + Arrays.deepToString(result2));
    }
}
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Sorting**: The intervals are sorted by their start times to handle overlaps efficiently.
2. **List Manipulation**: A `List<int[]>` is used to store the merged intervals dynamically.
3. **Overlap Check**: For each interval, the algorithm checks if it overlaps with the last merged interval. If yes, it merges them; otherwise, it adds the interval as a new entry.
4. **Output Conversion**: The merged list is converted back to a 2D array for the output.

### Output
For the given inputs:
- Input: `[[1, 3], [2, 6], [8, 10], [15, 18]]`  
  Output: `[[1, 6], [8, 10], [15, 18]]`
- Input: `[[1, 4], [4, 5]]`  
  Output: `[[1, 5]]`
