### Problem 227: Basic Calculator II

#### Problem Statement
Given a string `s` which represents an expression, evaluate this expression and return its value.  
The integer division should truncate toward zero.

You may assume that the given expression is always valid. All intermediate results will be in the range of `[-2^31, 2^31 - 1]`.

**Note**: You are not allowed to use any built-in function which evaluates strings as mathematical expressions, such as `eval()`.

---

#### Examples

1. **Input**: `s = "3+2*2"`  
   **Output**: `7`

2. **Input**: `s = " 3/2 "`  
   **Output**: `1`

3. **Input**: `s = " 3+5 / 2 "`  
   **Output**: `5`

---

#### Constraints
- `1 <= s.length <= 3 * 10^5`
- `s` consists of integers and operators (`'+'`, `'-'`, `'*'`, `'/'`) separated by some number of spaces.
- `s` represents a valid expression.
- All the integers in the expression are non-negative integers in the range `[0, 2^31 - 1]`.
- The answer is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

#### Topics
- String
- Stack
- Simulation

### Process (Plain English Explanation)

1. **Parse the Input**: Read through the string `s` while ignoring spaces.
2. **Use a Stack for Numbers**:
   - Maintain a stack to store numbers that are involved in addition/subtraction.
   - For multiplication and division, calculate the result immediately and update the last number in the stack.
3. **Process Operators**:
   - For `'+'` and `'-'`: Push the number (or its negative) to the stack.
   - For `'*'` and `'/'`: Compute the result with the top of the stack and replace it.
4. **Sum the Stack**: At the end, sum up all the numbers in the stack to get the result.

---

### Pseudocode

1. Initialize a stack to store numbers.
2. Initialize `currentNum` to `0` and `lastOperator` to `'+'`.
3. Loop through the string `s`:
   - If the character is a digit, update `currentNum`.
   - If the character is an operator or the last character:
     - Handle the last operator:
       - `'+'`: Push `currentNum` to the stack.
       - `'-'`: Push `-currentNum` to the stack.
       - `'*'`: Multiply the top of the stack by `currentNum` and replace it.
       - `'/'`: Divide the top of the stack by `currentNum` and replace it.
     - Update `lastOperator` and reset `currentNum`.
4. Sum up all the numbers in the stack and return the result.

### Java Solution

```java
import java.util.Stack;

class Solution {
    public int calculate(String s) {
        Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<>();
        int currentNum = 0;
        char lastOperator = '+';

        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            char c = s.charAt(i);

            if (Character.isDigit(c)) {
                currentNum = currentNum * 10 + (c - '0'); // Build the current number
            }

            if ((!Character.isDigit(c) && c != ' ') || i == s.length() - 1) {
                // Process the last operator
                if (lastOperator == '+') {
                    stack.push(currentNum);
                } else if (lastOperator == '-') {
                    stack.push(-currentNum);
                } else if (lastOperator == '*') {
                    stack.push(stack.pop() * currentNum);
                } else if (lastOperator == '/') {
                    stack.push(stack.pop() / currentNum);
                }

                // Update the operator and reset current number
                lastOperator = c;
                currentNum = 0;
            }
        }

        // Sum up all the numbers in the stack
        int result = 0;
        while (!stack.isEmpty()) {
            result += stack.pop();
        }

        return result;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution solution = new Solution();

        // Test case 1
        String s1 = "3+2*2";
        System.out.println("Input: \"" + s1 + "\" -> Output: " + solution.calculate(s1)); // Expected: 7

        // Test case 2
        String s2 = " 3/2 ";
        System.out.println("Input: \"" + s2 + "\" -> Output: " + solution.calculate(s2)); // Expected: 1

        // Test case 3
        String s3 = " 3+5 / 2 ";
        System.out.println("Input: \"" + s3 + "\" -> Output: " + solution.calculate(s3)); // Expected: 5
    }
}
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Stack Usage**:
   - The stack stores numbers involved in addition or subtraction.
   - Multiplication and division are calculated immediately, so only the final result is stored.
2. **Character Processing**:
   - Digits are used to build the current number.
   - Operators trigger calculations based on the previous operator.
3. **Final Result**:
   - The stack contains all the intermediate results, which are summed to get the final output.

### Outputs for Given Test Cases

1. **Input**: `"3+2*2"` -> **Output**: `7`
2. **Input**: `" 3/2 "` -> **Output**: `1`
3. **Input**: `" 3+5 / 2 "` -> **Output**: `5`
