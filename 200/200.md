### Problem 200: Number of Islands

#### Problem Statement
Given an `m x n` binary grid which represents a map of `'1'`s (land) and `'0'`s (water), return the number of islands.

An **island** is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.

#### Examples

1. **Input**:  
   ```
   grid = [
       ["1","1","1","1","0"],
       ["1","1","0","1","0"],
       ["1","1","0","0","0"],
       ["0","0","0","0","0"]
   ]
   ```
   **Output**: `1`

2. **Input**:  
   ```
   grid = [
       ["1","1","0","0","0"],
       ["1","1","0","0","0"],
       ["0","0","1","0","0"],
       ["0","0","0","1","1"]
   ]
   ```
   **Output**: `3`

---

#### Constraints
- `m == grid.length`
- `n == grid[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 300`
- `grid[i][j]` is either `'0'` or `'1'`.

---

#### Topics
- Array
- Depth-First Search (DFS)
- Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Union Find
- Matrix

---

### Process (Plain English Explanation)

1. **Traversal**: Iterate through the grid cell by cell.
2. **Check for Islands**:
   - If a cell contains `'1'`, it marks the start of a new island.
   - Increment the island count.
3. **Mark Connected Land**:
   - Use a DFS (or BFS) approach to mark all the cells in the current island as visited by converting `'1'` to `'0'`.
4. **Stop Condition**:
   - Stop exploring when all cells in the grid have been checked.

---

### Pseudocode

1. **Input**: A 2D grid.
2. Initialize `numIslands = 0` to count the islands.
3. For each cell `(i, j)` in the grid:
   - If `grid[i][j] == '1'`:
     - Increment `numIslands`.
     - Call a DFS function to mark all connected `'1'`s as `'0'`.
4. DFS Function:
   - Base Case: If the cell is out of bounds or not land, return.
   - Mark the cell as visited by setting it to `'0'`.
   - Recursively call DFS on the cell's four neighbors (up, down, left, right).
5. Return `numIslands`.

### Java Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public int numIslands(char[][] grid) {
        if (grid == null || grid.length == 0) return 0;

        int numIslands = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < grid.length; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < grid[0].length; j++) {
                if (grid[i][j] == '1') {
                    numIslands++;
                    markIsland(grid, i, j); // Perform DFS to mark the entire island
                }
            }
        }

        return numIslands;
    }

    private void markIsland(char[][] grid, int i, int j) {
        // Check bounds and if the cell is already water
        if (i < 0 || i >= grid.length || j < 0 || j >= grid[0].length || grid[i][j] == '0') {
            return;
        }

        grid[i][j] = '0'; // Mark the cell as visited

        // Explore the four adjacent directions
        markIsland(grid, i + 1, j); // Down
        markIsland(grid, i - 1, j); // Up
        markIsland(grid, i, j + 1); // Right
        markIsland(grid, i, j - 1); // Left
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution solution = new Solution();

        char[][] grid1 = {
            {'1', '1', '1', '1', '0'},
            {'1', '1', '0', '1', '0'},
            {'1', '1', '0', '0', '0'},
            {'0', '0', '0', '0', '0'}
        };
        System.out.println("Input: grid1 -> Output: " + solution.numIslands(grid1)); // Expected: 1

        char[][] grid2 = {
            {'1', '1', '0', '0', '0'},
            {'1', '1', '0', '0', '0'},
            {'0', '0', '1', '0', '0'},
            {'0', '0', '0', '1', '1'}
        };
        System.out.println("Input: grid2 -> Output: " + solution.numIslands(grid2)); // Expected: 3
    }
}
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **DFS for Island Marking**:
   - For each `'1'`, a recursive DFS marks the entire island (all connected `'1'`s) as `'0'`.
2. **Outer Traversal**:
   - The grid is traversed cell by cell. Each unvisited `'1'` starts a new island.
3. **Recursive Calls**:
   - Each DFS call explores all adjacent cells recursively.

### Outputs for Given Test Cases
1. **Input**:
   ```
   grid = [
       ["1","1","1","1","0"],
       ["1","1","0","1","0"],
       ["1","1","0","0","0"],
       ["0","0","0","0","0"]
   ]
   ```
   **Output**: `1`

2. **Input**:
   ```
   grid = [
       ["1","1","0","0","0"],
       ["1","1","0","0","0"],
       ["0","0","1","0","0"],
       ["0","0","0","1","1"]
   ]
   ```
   **Output**: `3`
